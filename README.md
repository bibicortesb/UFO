It can be filtered by Date, City, State, Country, Shape. 

Let's see an example:

In this example, I filtered by state Florida all UFOs Sphere shaped. Try yourself to fin useful insights!


## Summary

The webpage helps the user to better interact with data than in a spreedsheet. However, I belive there is more information filtering data could give us, such as a counter. For example, if I filtered FL, it would be nice to automatically know how many UFOs where registered insted of counting them mannually. That's why my first recomenation would be to include a counter display to facilitate acquiring this information. Another suggestion may be to further work on CSS for formatting purposes, making the website more visually attractive.
